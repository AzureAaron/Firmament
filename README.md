## NotEnoughUpdates 1.19

> This is still very much more of a tech demo, than an actual usable project. Please do not confuse it for one.

This project is subject to renaming. This is not NEU, but 1.19, even tho the goal is to have some of NEUs features.

### Currently working features

 - Item List of all SkyBlock Items
 - Grouping Items that belong together like minions
 - Recipe Viewer for Crafting Recipes
 - Recipe Viewer for Forge Recipes
 - Fishing Helper for Fishing particles (currently not working if you sneak because of 1.19 messing up positioning)
 - Fairy soul highlighter

Not working features:

 - A config gui, lol. All features are sort of on all the time. There is a config gui, but it is quite barren and not well documented.


### Building your own 

Use Java 17.

Running `./gradlew build` will create a mod jar in `build/libs`

You will need the fabric api mod, the fabric kotlin language mod, the architectury mod and REI in your mods folder in order for this mod to work.

### Licensing and contribution policy

Currently, this is under an All Rights Reserved sort of policy. There is currently no license im giving to anyone to make
use of this software. All the code in this repository I wrote myself, and I am planning to make it available under some
license pretty soon, but right now I am unsure of how some of the libraries I use will affect under what license i need
to publish this, so this is just a preliminary preview for now.

I will not accept contributions until I am sure of under which license I want to publish this mod and some of the
infrastructure is more defined.
