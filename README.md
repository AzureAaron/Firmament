> This is still very much more of a tech demo, than an actual usable project. Please do not confuse it for one.

### Building your own 

Use Java 17.

This depends on [neurepoparsing](https://git.nea.moe/nea/neurepoparsing/). Please clone that repository and make it available in your local maven repository using `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal`. This will be automated at a later stage. 


Afterwards, running `./gradlew build` will create a mod jar in `build/libs`
